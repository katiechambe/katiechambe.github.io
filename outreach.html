							<h2>Warrior scholar project</h2>
							<p> The <a href='https://www.warrior-scholar.org/'>Warrior Scholar Project</a> is a unique program developed to support 
								veterans across the country who are considering pursuing higher education after their service. During the 2 week program, students attend lectures,
								complete assigned readings and homework, and participate in research projects. In particular, the program: 1) 
								shows students that they are more than capable of returning to academia; 2) builds problem solving skills; and 3) introduces the students
								to the support structures and individuals that will continue to provide support for them after the conclusion of the program.								
								The program uniquely identifies the various specific needs of this population of students, 
								who often lie at a unique intersection between multiple minoritized identities in higher education 
								(including race, socio-economic background, educational background, etc). 
								Thus, they are able to provide informed support for the students as they transition from the military to higher education, 
								and provide the structure to ensure the existence of long-term support! </p>
							<p> <b>2019 - Research Project Leader</b>  In the summer of 2019, I worked with the Warrior Scholar Project as a 
								research project leader during the STEM week hosted at the University of Arizona. 
								I worked with 5 of the 15 students who participated in the WSP Arizona program, and created a series of 
								Jupyter Notebooks. The first notebook provided the students with an introduction to programming concepts in python.
								The following notebooks then built upon these learned programming skills to simulate exoplanet orbits and
								analyze light curve data from the <i>Kepler Space Telescope</i> database. The students learned about exoplanet 
								dynamics and detection methods, and presented their own exoplanet orbital models at the end of the program. </p>
							<p><b>2020 - Research Project Leader</b>  I worked with the Warrior Scholar Project again in the summer of 2020. 
								I was head research project leader, and managed the research project with 2 other graduate students 
								from the University of Arizona. The research project covered very similar content as in 2019. I adapted
								the Jupyter Notebooks from the previous year to better suit the needs of the students in the WSP program. 
								We spent a lot of time discussing exoplanet habitability and the search for intelligent life this year, which the students really enjoyed! 							
								For some insight into my own lessons learned and takeaways from leading the project this year, including some of the unique
								challenges that we faced from the pandemic, see <a href='blog/wsp2020.html'>Lessons learned from WSP</a>. 
								All of the materials that were used in the project are available to the public <a href='https://github.com/katiechambe/WSP2020'>on my github repository</a> 
								and hosted on <a href='http://tinyurl.com/WSP-Exoplanets2020'>Binder</a>.
